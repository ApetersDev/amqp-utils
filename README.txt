CLI utility programs for interacting with an AMQP queue. Using this utilities,
one can interact with an AMQP queue from the command line or via a shell
script.

These utilities have been tested against RabbitMQ, but they should work with
other AMQP compliant queues. They depend on the amqp gem available at 
(http://github.com/dougbarth/amqp, itself a fork of http://github.com/tmm1/amqp).
